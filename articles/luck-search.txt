For those that use my SearX instance (which was formerly searx.lukesmith.xyz), I
have now relocated it to searx.cedars.xyz[1], so if you use it as a default 
search engine, remember to change its url.
 
For those who don't know what SearX is, it's a metasearch engine that polls 
whatever search engines you want and aggregates the results. It is free software
that can be installed by anyone on any server.
 
Read more about it on their website[2], or find another instance to use[3], or 
install it on your own server[4].
