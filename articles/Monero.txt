Monero (abbreviated XMR) is easily the cryptocurrency most actually used as 
such. Unlike Bitcoin, Monero is actually private and has very low transaction 
fees. That makes it a good idea to get a Monero wallet and add an address on 
your website where you can receive donations.
 
Generate a Monero wallet
 
Go to Monero's official site[1] and you can download either the GUI (graphical) 
or CLI (command-line wallet). Some Linux distributions will have these packages 
in their repositories (monero and monero-gui on Arch-based distributions).
 
  If you are a Windows user, note that you will probably get some kind of 
  warning that you are installing something malicious. This is because many 
  malicious pieces of software include crypto miners in them. This wallet, 
  obviously, does include one as well, because it has the ability to mine if you
  want. You can disregard these messages and as that official site mentions, you
  can follow their directions to check the integrity of the download with 
  SHA256.
 
Once you install and run the wallet program, you will get a menu like this:

Now if you want to start using Monero and using it as a pro, you can choose to 
download the whole blockchain which will maximize your transactional privacy, 
however for this tutorial or setting up a wallet, we can just do the Simple Mode
and save our bandwidth. In fact, if you are paranoid, you can disconnect your 
computer from the internet while generating a wallet.
 
Now we choose to create a wallet.

Now we get the most important and sensitive part, you private mneumonic seed. 
These words are sacred! They are your money! To be clear, they are randomly 
generated words that seed the randomness required to unlock whatever money you 
receive or hold. Never show these words to anyone, don't even keep them on your 
computer, but write them down and store them securely in real life in a safe or 
somewhere where only you have access.

It goes without saying that the seed above that we generated for this tutorial 
should never be used by anyone since it is public on the internet and anyone 
could easily take the funds from the wallet.
 
Finally, we get to the main wallet screen. Now we see your public sharable 
wallet receiving address. It is the thing that starts with 4 and is too long to 
be included in the image below labeled "Primary address."
[image 4: address (link #5)] 
 
Click the clipboard next to it to copy the whole sequence (which will be more 
than 90 letters and numbers) to your clipboard. This is your address. Put it on 
your website and you can receive donations!
 
You can also click to save that QR code image and you can put it up on your 
website and people will be able to scan it and send you Monero. When scanned, 
that QR code will read as the public donation address.
 
What do I do now?
 
You can now receive Monero/XMR donations! All you need to do is put either your 
full address or your QR code on your site and people can send you tips in 
Monero.
 
Here is the address we use for this site (i.e. not the compromised wallet 
generated above):

It's now up to you how and where to display these on your site.
