What is OpenRAN? Stephan Avenwedde[1] Sat, 09/17/2022 - 03:00 
 
If you own and use a smartphone capable of connecting to arbitrary 
computers all over the world, then you are a user of Radio Access 
Networks (RAN). A RAN is provided by your cellular provider, and it 
handles wireless connections between your smartphone and your 
communication provider.
 
While your smartphone may be running an open source operating system 
(Android) and the server you try to access is probably running Linux, 
there's a lot of proprietary technology in between to make the 
connection happen. While you may have a basic understanding of how 
networking works locally, this knowledge stops when you plug a SIM card 
into your smartphone in order to make a connection with a cell tower 
possible. In fact, the majority of software and hardware components in 
and around a cell tower are still closed source, which of course has 
some drawbacks. This is where OpenRAN comes into play.
 
The OpenRAN initiative (shorthand for Open Radio Access Network) was 
started by the O-Ran Alliance[2], a worldwide community of mobile 
operators, vendors, and research and academic institutions. The 
initiative aims to define open standards between the various components 
of radio access networks. Interoperability between components of 
different manufacturers was not possible. Until now.

Radio Access Network
 
But what exactly is a RAN? In a nutshell, a RAN establishes a wireless 
connection to devices (smartphones, for example) and connects them to 
the core network of the communication company. In the context of a RAN, 
devices are denoted as User Equipment (UE).
 
The tasks of a RAN can be summarized as follows:
 
  * Authentication of UE
  * The handover of UE to another RAN (if the UE is moving)
  * Forwarding the data between the UE and the core network
  * Provision of the data for accounting functions (billing of services 
  or the transmitted data)
  * Control of access to the various services
 
OpenRAN
 
RAN usually consists of proprietary components. OpenRAN defines 
functional units and interfaces between them:
 
  * Radio Unit (RU): The RU is connected to the antenna and sends, 
  receives, amplifies, and digitizes radio signals.
  * Distributed Unit (DU): Handles the PHY[10], MAC[11] and RLC[12] 
  layer.
  * Centralised Unit (CU): Handles the RRC[13] and PDCP[14] layer.
  * RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC): Control and optimization of RAN 
  elements and resources.
 
Units are connected to each other by standardized, open interfaces. 
Furthermore, if the units can be virtualized and deployed in the cloud 
or on an edge device[15], then it's called a vRAN (virtual Radio Access 
Network). The basic principle of vRAN is to decouple the hardware from 
the software by using a software-based virtualization layer. Using a 
vRAN improves flexibility in terms of scalability and the underlying 
hardware.
 
OpenRAN for everyone
 
By the definition of functional units and the interfaces between them, 
OpenRAN enables interoperability of components from different 
manufacturers. This reduces the dependency for cellular providers of 
specific vendors and makes communication infrastructure more flexible 
and resilient. As a side-effect, using clearly defined functional units 
and interfaces drives innovation and competition. With vRAN, the use of 
standard hardware is possible. With all these advantages, OpenRAN is a 
prime example of how open source benefits everyone.
 
Open Radio Access Network defines open standards between the various 
components of radio access networks.
