[general]

# smoothing mode, can be normal, scientific or waves.
; mode = normal

# Framerate Default: 60. Accepts only non-negative values.
framerate = 60

# Sensitivity in  %. If you think the bars are to low/response is to littei, try
# increasing this value 200 means double height. Accepts only non-negative values.
sensitivity = 100

# Autosens will atempt to decrease sensitivity if cava peaks. 1 = on, 0 = off
autosens = 1

# The number of bars. 0 (default) sets it to auto (fil upp console).
# width of bras and space between bars in number of characters. Default witdth 3 and space 1.
; bars = 0
bar_width = 3
bar_spacing = 1

# Lower cutoff freq for lowest bar and higheset for highest bar
# the bandwith of the visualizer, defaults to 50 - 10000 Hz
# Note: there is a minimum total bandwith of 43Mhz x number of bars.
# Cava will automaticly increase the higher cuttoff if a too low band is specified.
; lower_cutoff_freq = 50
; higher_cutoff_freq = 10000

[input]

# method of capturing audio, supported input methods are: 'pulse', 'alsa' or 'fifo'.
# Defaults to 'alsa'
#
# for pulseaudio 'source' wil be the source. Default: 'NULL', which uses system default source
# all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them
# but the default, might be your microphone, try the command 'pacmd list-sources' to find the right one
# you can change source here to the name of your prefered device, or cahnge your default pulseaudio source by running
# 'pacmd set-default-source NAME|#N'
#
# for alsa 'source' will be the capture device. Default: 'hw:Loopback,1'
# for fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file. Default: '/tmp/mpd.fifo'
; method = alsa
; source = hw:Loopback,1

method = fifo
source = /tmp/mpd.fifo

; method = pulse
; source = 3

[output]

# method used to draw output may be ncurses, noncurses.
#method = ncurses

# visual styles, may be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# Stereo mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# Mono avrages both channels and outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies
style = stereo

[color]

# supported colors are: red, green, yellow, magenta, cyan, white, blue, black.
; background = black
; foreground = cyan

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.
# Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within ''). User defined colors requires
# ncurses output method and a terminal that can change color definitions such as Gnome-terminal or rxvt.
# if supported, ncurses mode will be forced on if user defined colors are used.
# default is to keep current terminal color
; background = default
; foreground = default

# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors (and thereby ncurses mode) are supported,
# background must also be defined in hex  or remain commented out. 1 = on, 0 = off.
# You can define as many as 8 different colors. They range from bottom to top of screen

# gradient = 1
# gradient_count = 6
# gradient_color_1 = '#506AB8'
# gradient_color_2 = '#A290AC'
# gradient_color_3 = '#C578C4'
# gradient_color_4 = '#A270C7'
# gradient_color_5 = '#B59BC8'
# gradient_color_6 = '#976DA5'

 gradient_color_1 = '#59cc33'
 gradient_color_2 = '#80cc33'
 gradient_color_3 = '#a6cc33'
 gradient_color_4 = '#cccc33'

[smoothing]

# multiplier for the integral smoothing calculations. Takes values from 0 - 0.99.
# Higher values means smoother, but less precise. 0 to disable.
; integral = 0.7

# disables or enables the so-called "Monstercat smoothing". Default: 1. Set to 0 to disable.
monstercat = 1

# Set gravity multiplier for "drop off". Higher values means bars will drop faster.
# Accepts only non-negative values. 0.5 means half gravity, 2 means double. Set to 0 to disable "drop off".
; gravity = 1

# In bar height, bars that whould have been lower that this will not be drawn.
; ignore = 0

[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want.
# remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
; 1 = 1 # bass
; 2 = 1
; 3 = 1 # midtone
; 4 = 1
; 5 = 1 # treble
