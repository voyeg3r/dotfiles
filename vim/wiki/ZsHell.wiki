==how to show a function definition==
reference: http://va.mu/BLEHZ

  functions func_name

you can use =command instead $(which command)

==Just found this little gem==

cd old new

This form of cd replaces all occurences of old in the full path of the present directory with new and tries to change the working directory to the resulting path.

For example, if your working directory is /home/larry/code/backrub/server and you want to switch to /home/sergei/code/backrub/server, all you need to do is:

cd larry sergei


==zsh buffer stack==

  If you type

  ls -L /etc/some_command

  and them press Esc-q to call man ls
  when you exit the manual the last command reapers

  and if you are typing a command and press Esc-h, iven if
  you are in the middle of a typed command, zsh will show you
  the required manual

==how upgrade oh-my-zsh==


    Open up Terminal

    Type in '~/.oh-my-zsh', this should change your directory to the zsh directory.
    -Terminal should read: " .oh-my-zsh git:(master) ". If it does, go to step 3.

    Type in "git status" to see that your status is ahead of master.
    -If you're not concerned about the file status changes, you can "stash" those changes by doing step 4.

    Type in "git stash" to save the progress in the git and move the head back to master.
    Done. Now you should be able to upgrade the next time the terminal asks you too.

    now type

				upgrade_oh_my_zsh

		now type

				git stash pop

=fasd tool shortcuts==

  fasd is a tools installed in zsh environment

  f foo           # list frecent files matching foo
  a foo bar       # list frecent files and directories matching foo and bar
  f js$           # list frecent files that ends in js
  f -e vim foo    # run vim on the most frecent file matching foo
  mplayer `f bar` # run mplayer on the most frecent file matching bar
  z foo           # cd into the most frecent directory matching foo
  open `sf pdf`   # interactively select a file matching pdf and launch `open`

	# aliases para fasd
	alias a='fasd -a'        # any
	alias s='fasd -si'       # show / search / select
	alias d='fasd -d'        # directory
	alias f='fasd -f'        # file
	alias sd='fasd -sid'     # interactive directory selection
	alias sf='fasd -sif'     # interactive file selection
	alias z='fasd_cd -d'     # cd, same functionality as j in autojump
	alias zz='fasd_cd -d -i' # cd with interactive selection
	alias v='f -e vim'       # open file with vim
	alias o='a -e xdg-open'  # quick opening files with xdg-open#

= changing the shell =

	sudo chsh -s $(which zsh) $(whoami)

= one-liners =

# lowcase filenames - source: http://lorenzod8n.wordpress.com/category/zsh/

		for file in *; do mv $file ${file:l}; done
		for p in ~/pictures/**/*[A-Z]*; do mv $p ${p:l}; done

An application of modifiers is !:t, which results into the basename of
the last argument. Very useful when working with URLs, for example.
You’ll never have to strip the path manually again:

% wget ftp://ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.7-p330.tar.gz
% tar xzvf !:t


# this command

						ls -1 */**/*.sh

# is equivalent to:

						find -iname "*.sh" -printf "\n%f"

# to show files created less than one day

        ls -1 *(.m-1)

   the option -1 sets one result per line
   and the dot '.' alows only regular files
   the 'm-1' asks modifications at less than one day


#  find all files with size larger than 10 megabytes

        ls **/*(.Lm+10)

# find all files you accessed within the last month:

        ls **/*(.aM-1)

# list files not ending with 'o'

        echo *.[^o]

# avoinding files that start with uppercase

        echo [^[:upper:]]*

# files changed in the last hour

        echo *(mh-1)

Nevertheless, you could also check for either

    acced or changed in the last hour
    access ................. (ah-1)
    or creation ............ (ch-1)

    acced or changed in the last minute
    access ................. (am-1)
    or creation ............ (cm-1)

    acced or changed in the last Month
    access ................. (aM-1)
    or creation ............ (cM-1)

    changed at more than 3 weeks (mw+3)

    (Lm+5) —larger than five megabytes.

    ls **/*(.) .......... regular files
    ls **/*(^.) ......... not regular files
    ls **/*(@) .......... simbolic links
    ls **/*(*) .......... executable files
    ls **/*(rwx) ........ readable writable and executable by user
    ls **/*(m-1) ........ modification time -1 24h
    ls **/*(mm-1) ....... modification minute -1
    ls **/*(M-1) ........ modification time -1 month
    ls **/*(mh-1) ....... modification hour
    ls **/*(a+1) .......  acces more than one day
    ls **/*(aM+1) ....... acces more than one month
    ls **/*(.DmM+12) .... regular files older thant one year
    ls **/*(L+10M) ...... file more than 10M
    ls **/*(*Lk-5) ...... executable files less than 5kb

    ls *(.D)  ........... D dotfiles '.' regular files

    ls -l **/*(.Lm-2mh-1om[1,3])
    Lm-2 # <2mbs
    mh-1 # less 1 hr
    om[1,3] most recent 3

    (om) tells the glob to sort the remaining files by their modification date.

Note that the default unit for this qualifier is days, so (m-1) will mean a day ago or, more precisely, up to 24 hours before the current system time.

=zsh completions for yaourt=

http://youtu.be/mCHwb_TD4ng

1) First install aur-git and run sudo aur to build local database.
2) Grab this function I sloppily put together:

# http://pastebin.com/EJrzSh5A
# -----8<------------------------
#compdef yaourt
typeset -A opt_args

_localaur () { compadd $(ls /var/aur/) ; }
_yaourt() {
'_localaur'
}


_yaourt "$@"

# -----8<------------------------

and put it in a directory other then the default functions directory for zsh ( I am using $HOME/.zsh/functions ).


3) Add a directory to your fpath in your .zshrc so as not to conflict with the original completion script for yaourt.

fpath=( $HOME/.zsh/functions $fpath )


Now tab away and enjoy.

That's it. Thanks for watching.

=use r to repeat the last command - with substituition =

  echo one two
  r two=three
  one three

= print var in lowcase =

		echo $var:l

=how set up 'command not found'=

		ls -l */**(.m3)

# show empty files
ls -l foldero/**/*(L0)

# show files greater than 3 KB
ls -l foldero/**/*(Lk+3)

# show files modified in the last hour
print -l foldero/**/*(mh-1)

# shortcut to show or manipulate most recent file
 for example

    ls Ctrl-x Ctrl-m

The above shortuc will put the most recent file name in command line

# sort files from most to least recently modified and show the last 3

   list the most recent file
		ls -l */**(.om[1])

    # vi newest file
		vi *(.om[1])

   ls -l **/*(*)

# You can access zmv's advanced documentation by typing man zshcontrib.
# zmv "programmable rename"
autoload -U zmv

# rename txt to rb

    zmv -Wv '*.txt' '*.rb'

with the '-n' option you can only see what will happen
without actualy changing any file.

    zmv -n (*) ${(U)1}

#Replace spaces in filenames with underline

		zmv '* *' '$f:gs/ /_'

		zmv '*' '$f:s/hell/heaven/'

zmv '(* *)' '${1// /}'
zmv -Q "(**/)(* *)(D)" "\$1\${2// /_}"
# Change the suffix from *.sh to *.pl
zmv -W '*.sh' '*.pl'
# lowercase/uppercase all files/directories
