### some google secrets

Manipulate the google engine by using it to locate mp3 files online as well as
some free software, and more! Using Google, and some finely crafted searches we
can find a lot of interesting information.

For Example we can find:

* Passwords
* Software / MP3′s
* etc.

Presented below is just a sample of interesting searches that we can send to
google to obtain info. After you get a taste using some of these, try your own
crafted searches to find info that you would be interested in.

Try a few of these searches:

    intitle:"Index of" passwords modified
    allinurl:auth_user_file.txt

    “access denied for user” “using password”

    “A syntax error has occurred” filetype:ihtml

    allinurl: admin mdb

    “ORA-00921: unexpected end of SQL command”

    inurl:passlist.txt

    “Index of /backup”

    “Chatologica MetaSearch” “stack tracking:”

And these:

    “parent directory ” /appz/ -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums
    “parent directory ” DVDRip -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums
    “parent directory “Xvid -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums
    “parent directory ” Gamez -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums
    “parent directory ” MP3 -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -opendivx -md5 -md5sums
    “parent directory ” Name of Singer or album -xxx -html -htm -php -shtml -
    opendivx -md5 -md5sums

Notice that I am only changing the word after the parent directory, change it
to what you want and you will get a lot of stuff.

### method 2

put this string in google search:

    intitle:index.of mp3

You only need add the name of the song/artist/singer. Example: intitle:index.of mp3 jackson

### method 3

put this string in google search:

    inurl:microsoft filetype:iso

You can change the string to watever you want, ex. microsoft to adobe, iso to
zip etc…

    “AutoCreate=TRUE password=*”

This searches the password for “Website Access Analyzer”, a Japanese software that creates webstatistics. For those who can read Japanese, check out the
author’s site at: coara.or.jp/~passy/ [coara.or.jp/~passy/]

    “http://*:*@www” domainname

This is a query to get inline passwords from search engines (not just Google),
you must type in the query followed with the the domain name without the .com
or .net

     Another way is by just typing
     “http://bob:bob@www”

     “sets mode: +k”
     This search reveals channel keys (passwords) on IRC as revealed from IRC chat
     logs.

     allinurl: admin mdb
     Not all of these pages are administrator’s access databases containing
     usernames, passwords and other sensitive information, but many are!

         allinurl:auth_user_file.txt

     DCForum’s password file. This file gives a list of (crackable) passwords,
     usernames and email addresses for DCForum and for DCShop (a shopping cart
     program(!!!). Some lists are bigger than others, all are fun, and all belong to
     googledorks. =)

         intitle:”Index of” config.php

     This search brings up sites with “config.php” files. To skip the technical
     discussion, this configuration file contains both a username and a password for
     an SQL database. Most sites with forums run a PHP message base. This file gives
     you the keys to that forum, including FULL ADMIN access to the database.

     eggdrop filetype:user user

     These are eggdrop config files. Avoiding a full-blown descussion about eggdrops
     and IRC bots, suffice it to say that this file contains usernames and passwords
     for IRC users.

     Note: This is for informational purposes only. Do not use any of this
     information for illegal uses. Again, this is for demonstrational purposes.
     HacknMod is not responsible for your actions and does not promote illegal or
     malicious actvities.
