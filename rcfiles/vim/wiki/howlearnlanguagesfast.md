### Introduction
Bellow I will show you some insights and ideas that I
develop or learned from other researchers that helped
me to reach my current level in English, but do not forget, after
achive one level in one language you must start a new
jorney to the next level, there is not end to the learn
process

### Motivation
The most important thing to learn not only English is motivation,
and it is not enough say: I want to learn English, or I want to
learn Spanish, you must figure out more than that, for example:

I want to learn English to earn more money
I want to learn English to become a citizen of the world and
be able to travell all around the world.
I want to learn English to watch my kung fu master seminars.
I want to learn English to get a girlfriend or boyfrind.

Notice the difference between: I want to learn English and I want
to learn English to do something, because English in itself do not
gives you the real motivation, you have to have enough fuel to reach
your goral, and remember your target is not learn and after that
lose the skill, you will have to make use of the language after
learn.

### Learn phrases not isolated words
By doing that you will learn grammar by context, in fact
you will learn using the lexical approach in wich the extructures
of the language is that gives you the hability do comprehend the meaning

# Listen a lot
Listen the real language every day, because your brain need to
be used with the sounds and you will only develop a good
pronunciation interacting with the real thing, remember
the low of use, the nature never fails.
