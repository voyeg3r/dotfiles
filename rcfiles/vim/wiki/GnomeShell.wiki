    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface clock-show-date true

   # do not show menu on terminal

   gsettings set org.gnome.Terminal.Legacy.Settings default-show-menubar false

   gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.datetime automatic-timezone true

==Increasing the sound through command line==

    pactl set-sink-volume 0 +10%

    And to make the volume go down by the same amount, the command would be:

    pactl set-sink-volume 0 -- -10%

==touche to click on touchpad==

    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad tap-to-click true

==Set keyboard language==

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.input-sources sources "[('xkb', 'br'), ('xkb', 'us')]"

==change wallpaper every so many minutes ==

#!/bin/sh
echo $DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS > $HOME/.dbus_session_bus_address

(You can name the file in the echo command whatever you want, but it's a dot-file in order to keep it hidden from ordinary listings.)

Run the echo command from a shell (or from the Run prompt accessed by Alt+F2) so that you don't have to log out for the shuffling to start.  Otherwise, just log out and log in again after you follow all the rest of these instructions.

Change the file permissions to executable.  To do that in a shell, use the command:

chmod a+x ~/bin/login-script.sh

# dentro de .config/autostart coloque

    [Desktop Entry]
    Name=MyScript
    GenericName=A descriptive name
    Comment=Some description about your script
    Exec=/path/to/my/script.sh
    Terminal=false
    Type=Application
    X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true

==Show current wallpaper path==

    gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.background picture-uri

==setting nautilus auto mount==

    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.media-handling automount true

==fixing audacious open folders error==

I don't know how it happened but
when, eg, I plug in a USB drive or try to open a folder in a firefox
extension (or other programs that want to open a folder...), it always
wants to open with Audacious which is obnoxious.  Browsing through in
Nautilus works fine and normal, but I want to know if I can find out how
to get rid of the association with Audacious.

    I've tried deleting ~/.config and ~/.local to no help...

    Create the file

    ~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list

    and fill it with

    [Default Applications]
    inode/directory=nautilus.desktop;

== setting gnome screenshot dir ==

  gsettings set org.gnome.gnome-screenshot auto-save-directory "file:///home/$USER/pictures/"

==setando o muse para ser destacado com o ctrl ou não==

  gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.mouse locate-pointer false

== habilitando o click to tap no mouse ==

gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.peripherals.touchpad tap-to-click true

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals-touchpad disable-while-typing true


gconftool-2 --toggle /desktop/gnome/peripherals/touchpad/touchpad-enabled

habilitar a rolagem pela borda to touchpad

    gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.peripherals.touchpad scroll-method "edge-scrolling"

== accessing ssh throug nautilus ==

    sftp://user@address/folder/

-------------------------------
 disable most recent files view --> recently-used-xbel
-------------------------------

Put the following in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini (create the file if
it doesn’t exist):

        [Settings]
        gtk-recent-files-max-age=0
        gtk-recent-files-limit=0

    Then, remove the file holding recently-used data:

        rm ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel

Disabling tracer system

    tracker-control

If you had customized /etc/sysctl.conf, you need to rename it as
/etc/sysctl.d/99-sysctl.conf. If you had e.g. /etc/sysctl.d/foo, you
need to rename is to /etc/sysctl.d/foo.conf
