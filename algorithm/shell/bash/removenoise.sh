# By utilizing SoX audio software, the microphone input is redirected through it,
# and output into a loopback device, which can be chosen in PulseAudioâ€™s volume
# mixer application. I have composed a bash script to essentially automate the
# process. Before using this, SoX must be installed, and the alsa loopback device
# must be loaded into the kernel:

# sudo apt-get install sox

# sudo modprobe snd_aloop

###

# This script first tests to make sure the loopback devices are loaded, then
# records a 5 second noise sample. The sample is then played back to the user. If
# there should be a problem with it, such as a non-background sound leaked into
# it, it can be re-recorded. Once done, the input and output devices are
# determined, and an audio stream is directed from PulseAudio into SoX, then back
# into Pulse through the loopback device. From PulseAudio Volume Control, the
# input of recording devices can be changed to Loopback Analog Stereo Monitor,
# where the filtered audio stream is being directed.
